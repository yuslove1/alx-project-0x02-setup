# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository contains the initial setup and basic implementation of a Next.js project. It includes the configuration for TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, basic routing using the Pages Router, and the creation of several reusable components like a Card, Modal, and Button. This project serves as a foundation for building more complex Next.js applications and ultimately an Airbnb clone.
